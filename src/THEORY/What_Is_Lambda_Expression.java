public class What_Is_Lambda_Expression {

/*
  Lambda Expression is one of the most important feature which was 
  introduced in JAVA 1.8 VERSION.it is type of anonymous function (no name , no modifier , no return type)
   
  
   BENEFITES OF LAMBDA EXPRESSION :-
   
   1. reduces the lines of code.
   2. sequential and parallel execution support by passing behavior as 
      an argument in methods.
   3. to call APIs is very effectively.
   4. to write more readable , maintainable and concise code.   
   
   

EXAMPLE : NO LAMBDA = public static void sayHello()(System.out.println("HELLO)};
         LAMBDA = ()->{System.out.println("HELLO)};

 
 
 IMPORTANT RULES OF LAMBDA :-
 
 1.if the body of lambda expression contain only one statement then curly
   braces are optional.
 
 FOR EXAMPLE : ()-> System.out.println("HELLO");
 
 
 2.java complier also enter the type of variable passed in arguments , 
   hence type is optional.
   
 FOR EXAMPLE : (a,b)->{
               System.out.println("HELLO");
               return a+b;
                }
